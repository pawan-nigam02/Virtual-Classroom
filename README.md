3. Styling
The styling for the frontend is managed with CSS to ensure a cohesive look and feel.
•	Global Styles: Applied to ensure a consistent appearance across the application, including margins, padding, and font settings.
•	Navbar Styling: Custom styles for the navigation bar, including background color, text color, and hover effects.
•	Home Page Styling: Styles for the home page background, card layouts, and buttons.

4. Installation and Running
1.	Clone the Frontend Repository
                                                           Command:-  git clone <repository-url>
2.	Navigate to the Frontend Directory
                                                            Command:-  cd frontend
3.	Install Dependencies
                                                              Command:-  npm install
4.	Start the Development Server
                                                               Command:-  npm start
o	Access the application at http://localhost:3000.
Backend
1. Introduction
The backend of the Virtual Classroom project is built with Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It handles server-side logic and provides API endpoints for data management.
2. API Endpoints
User Endpoint
•	Purpose: Provides user-related information.
•	Endpoint: /api/user/:id
•	Method: GET
•	Response:
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "courses": [
    { "courseId": 1, "courseName": "Introduction to Programming" },
    { "courseId": 2, "courseName": "Web Development" }
  ]
}
3. Server Setup
1.	Dependencies: Uses Express.js, body-parser for JSON handling, and CORS for cross-origin resource sharing.
2.	Configuration: The server listens on port 5000 by default. Ensure this port is open and not used by other applications.
4. Installation and Running
1.	Clone the Backend Repository
                                                     Command:-  git clone <repository-url>
2.	Navigate to the Backend Directory
                                                      Command:-  cd backend
3.	Install Dependencies
                                                    Command:-   npm install
4.	Start the Server
                                                 Command:-  node server.js
o	The backend server will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.
Integration
1. Connecting Frontend to Backend
•	Frontend Configuration: Ensure that API requests in the frontend are directed to the backend server URL. This typically involves updating the base URL in your API service files.
•	Testing API Endpoints: Use tools like Postman or CURL to verify that backend endpoints are responding correctly before integrating with the frontend.
•	Error Handling: Implement error handling in the frontend to manage scenarios where the backend may be unreachable or return errors.
2. Synchronizing Data
Ensure that data formats between the frontend and backend are consistent. The frontend should correctly handle the JSON responses provided by the backend and update the UI accordingly.
Development Workflow
1.	Planning and Design
o	Define project scope, user requirements, and technical specifications.
o	Design wireframes and mockups for user interfaces.
2.	Development
o	Frontend: Build components and apply styles. Implement routing and API integration.
o	Backend: Develop API endpoints, configure the server, and manage data.
3.	Testing
o	Unit Testing: Test individual components and functions.
o	Integration Testing: Ensure that the frontend and backend work together as expected.
o	User Testing: Conduct user testing to gather feedback and make improvements.
4.	Deployment
o	Frontend: Deploy to a hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
o	Backend: Deploy to a cloud service or server (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
5.	Maintenance
o	Monitor application performance and user feedback.
o	Update features, fix bugs, and improve functionality based on user needs and technological advancements.

Conclusion
The Virtual Classroom project documentation provides a thorough guide from initial setup to deployment. By following these instructions, you can successfully build, run, and maintain a robust online learning platform.
